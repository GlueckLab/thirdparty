<project name="Third party libraries for GLIMMPSE" default="build-distributions">
	
	<!--
	The libraries contained in this distribution are not a part of Glimmpse Software system
 nor were they created by the authors listed in the Glimmpse source code.  In most cases,
 the distributions were trimmed to include only the jar files directly needed to compile
 the components of the Glimmpse software system.
 <p></p>
 The libraries are provided as a convenience to individuals who wish to compile the
 Glimmpse system from source code.  A good faith effort has been made to include 
 appropriate licensing information with each distribution.

Please see the README.txt file for more details
