WARNING 2: B = 1, so that all tests coincide (univariate case). Since COLLAPSE =
1, power is given as one value with the heading POWER. To print powers with a   
heading for each test, specify OPT_OFF = {COLLAPSE}.                            

                                        

WARNING 10: SIGMA is a scalar. For this program, a scalar SIGMA must equal the  
variance, NOT the standard deviation.                                           

                                        

POWER CALCULATION WARNING 22: Power values were rounded to 1 using the value    
contained in ROUND and should not be be reported as Power = 1. For example, if  
ROUND = 3 then report Power > 0.999 . This occurred 23 time(s).
